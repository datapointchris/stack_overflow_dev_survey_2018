## Load Data

```{r}
public <- read.csv("survey_results_public.csv")
```


## Data Cleaning


## Step 1 - Select Columns for Dashboard

```{r}
subset(public, select = c(66))
```


```{r}
public_subset <- subset(public, select = c(1:17, 55, 66, 120:129))
```


## Step 2 - Rename columns to snake case.


```{r}
renamed_public <- public_subset %>% rename(respondent="Respondent", hobby="Hobby", open_source="OpenSource", 
                               country="Country", student="Student", employment="Employment",
                               formal_education="FormalEducation", undergrad_major="UndergradMajor",
                               company_size="CompanySize", dev_type="DevType", years_coding="YearsCoding",
                               years_coding_prof="YearsCodingProf", job_satisfaction="JobSatisfaction",
                               career_satisfaction="CareerSatisfaction", hope_five_years="HopeFiveYears",
                               job_search_status="JobSearchStatus", last_new_job="LastNewJob", exercise="Exercise",
                               gender="Gender", sexual_orientation="SexualOrientation", education_parents="EducationParents",
                               race_ethnicity="RaceEthnicity", age="Age", dependents="Dependents", military_US="MilitaryUS",
                               survey_too_long="SurveyTooLong", survey_easy="SurveyEasy", converted_salary="ConvertedSalary",
                               language_worked_with="LanguageWorkedWith")
```


## Step 3 - Check Unique Values on Columns


```{r}
unique(renamed_public$hobby)
unique(renamed_public$open_source)
unique(renamed_public$country)
unique(renamed_public$student)
unique(renamed_public$employment)
unique(renamed_public$formal_education)
unique(renamed_public$undergrad_major)

unique(renamed_public$exercise)
unique(renamed_public$gender)
unique(renamed_public$sexual_orientation)
unique(renamed_public$education_parents)
unique(renamed_public$race_ethnicity)
unique(renamed_public$age)
unique(renamed_public$dependents)
unique(renamed_public$military_US)
unique(renamed_public$survey_too_long)
unique(renamed_public$survey_easy)
```


## Step 4 - Fix Encoding Errors and shorten long column names


```{r}

```


```{r}

unique(renamed_public$survey_easy)
```


## Step 5 - Drop military_US column


```{r}
public_data <- select(renamed_public, -military_US)
```

```{r}
unique(public_data$years_coding_prof)
```


```{r}
